## Inspiration and Project Proposal

Inspired by systems used by Amazon and Mercado Livre in their warehouses, where robots are employed for transport, our team aims to develop a system that enables item transportation within a warehouse in a nearly fully automated manner. This project involves designing both the drones and their electronics, as well as developing an app to serve as a user interface and a server to store information and control the drones.
